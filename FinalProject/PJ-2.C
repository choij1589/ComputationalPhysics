// 2. N identical particles - that are connected in series
// by the springs as shown below - move along the x axis,
// where all the particles have the mass m and all the springs
// have the spring constant k.
// For the case of N = 100, plot the resonance frequency w[(k/m)^(1/2)]
// with respect to the number n of the nodes for each corresponding mode.

// -> Save the source code as PJ-2.C and submit it.
// -> List w(n) in the report.
// -> By use of any graphic softward, plot w(n) in the report.
